# Auralyn 🎧

**A minimal demo UI for a music app** — clean, modern, and intentionally simple.

---

## Demo Screenshots ✅

These are lightweight demo images located in `assets/demo/` (kept small and minimal).

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/demo/home.jpeg" alt="Home" style="max-width:360px;max-height:720px;border-radius:12px;margin:6px;" />
  <img src="assets/demo/song.jpeg" alt="Song" style="max-width:360px;max-height:720px;border-radius:12px;margin:6px;" />
  <img src="assets/demo/splash.jpeg" alt="Splash" style="max-width:360px;max-height:720px;border-radius:12px;margin:6px;" />
</p>

> Note: Images are constrained with `max-width:360px` and `max-height:720px` so they remain minimal and don't dominate the README.

## About Auralyn 💡

Auralyn is a demo app design (not a full product). The UI is inspired by **@zesignli.uix** — it's a visual concept created to show a clean music player layout and micro-interactions.
