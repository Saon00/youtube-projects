# Auralyn 🎧

**A minimal demo UI for a music app** — clean, modern, and intentionally simple.

## Demo Screenshots ✅

These are lightweight demo images located in `assets/demo/` (kept small and minimal).

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-around; align-items: flex-start; gap: 15px;">
  <img src="assets/demo/home.jpeg" alt="Home Screen" style="width: 320px; height: 680px; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 5px; margin: 6px; object-fit: cover;" />
  <img src="assets/demo/song.jpeg" alt="Song Screen" style="width: 320px; height: 680px; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 5px; margin: 6px; object-fit: cover;" />
  <img src="assets/demo/splash.jpeg" alt="Splash Screen" style="width: 320px; height: 680px; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 5px; margin: 6px; object-fit: cover;" />
</div>

> Note: Images are constrained to **width: 320px** and **height: 680px** (using `object-fit: cover`) so they remain minimal and consistent across devices.

## About Auralyn 💡

Auralyn is a demo app design (not a full product). The UI is inspired by **@zesignli.uix** — it's a visual concept created to show a clean music player layout and micro-interactions.
